For example, no one has provided a description for the code, or you might have wired a number that is not an error code to the error code input. 		Additionally, undefined error codes might occur because the error relates to a third-party object, such as the operating system or ActiveX. For these third-party errors, you might be able to obtain a description of the error by searching the Web for the error code (-2147217843) or for its hexadecimal representation (0x80040E4D).

For example, no one has provided a description for the code, or you might have wired a number that is not an error code to the error code input. 		Additionally, undefined error codes might occur because the error relates to a third-party object, such as the operating system or ActiveX. For these third-party errors, you might be able to obtain a description of the error by searching the Web for the error code (-2147217900) or for its hexadecimal representation (0x80040E14).
